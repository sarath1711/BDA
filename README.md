# K-Means Clustering on Telecom Customers

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs **K-Means clustering** on a telecom customer dataset to discover meaningful customer segments for business insights and strategy development.

## 📊 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique in customer analytics that allows businesses to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors. This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning — specifically K-Means clustering — can be used to classify customers into segments based on their usage patterns and demographics.
